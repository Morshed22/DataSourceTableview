# Cooking app

In this exercise applicant should implement a new feature into an existing sample app.

## Sample application

A simple application with three screens. 

* Recipes screen - a screen that loads and displays a list of cooking recipes. Cooking recipes have three difficulties easy, normal and hard.
* Recipe screen - a screen that displays recipe, photo and allows user to mark this recipe as done. When user marks recipe as done, he specifies if he was successful or not.
* Attempted recipes screen - a screen that shows recipes that the user has already tried to prepare.

## Requirements

* Application should select a recommended recipe based on these criteria:
    * If use has never tried any recipe before, app should recommend one of the low difficulty recipes;
    * If user has prepared any recipes before, app should determine his skill level based on the last several tries and recommend a recipe that matches user's skill level.

## Some recommendations for the exercise
