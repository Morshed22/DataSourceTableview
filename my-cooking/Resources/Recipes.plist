		<string>Ingredients

20 large shrimp, deveined with shell and head left on 
4 tomatoes, or more to taste 
1 bunch flat-leaf parsley, divided 
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 
1 large onion, chopped 
1 red bell pepper, chopped 
1 fresh red chile pepper, finely chopped 
4 large cloves garlic, sliced, or more to taste 
1/2 cup water 
2 tablespoons tomato paste 
1 tablespoon dried oregano 
salt and ground black pepper to taste 
1 teaspoon paprika 
1 5/8 pounds spaghetti (optional) 

Directions

1. Peel shrimp and place skin, heads, and tails into a large saucepan. Fill pan with water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and let simmer, about 45 minutes. 
2. Combine tomatoes and 1/2 the parsley in a blender; puree until smooth. 
3. Heat olive oil in a separate pan over medium heat. Add onion, bell pepper, and chile pepper; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant but not browned, 1 to 2 minutes. 
4. Pour pureed tomato mixture into the pan with the peppers. Add water, tomato paste, oregano, salt, and black pepper. Stir well; add paprika. Let sauce simmer on low to medium heat until juices have reduced. 
5. Strain shrimp shells from the water. Bring water back to a boil and add spaghetti. Cook spaghetti, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Reserve 1 cup of the cooking water and drain the rest. 
6. In the meantime, add shrimp to the tomato sauce. Add the reserved water, stir well, and cook until shrimp is pink, about 3 minutes. Plate spaghetti and spoon the sauce on top; garnish with the remaining parsley.

		<string>&quot;This recipe goes together quickly and does not need a lot of time in the slow cooker. It&apos;s a delicious way to add flavor to ground beef and the children love it! The gravy is delightful served over mashed potatoes.&quot;
Ingredients

    2 pounds lean ground beef
    1 (1 ounce) envelope dry onion soup mix
    1/2 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs
    1/4 cup milk
    1/4 cup all-purpose flour

    In a large bowl, mix together the ground beef, onion soup mix, bread crumbs, and milk using your hands. Shape into 8 patties.

Cook on the Low setting for 4 or 5 hours, until ground beef is well done.

		<string>&quot;A very quick and easy fix to a tasty side-dish. Fancy, designer mac and cheese often costs forty or fifty dollars to prepare when you have so many exotic and expensive cheeses, but they aren&apos;t always the best tasting. This recipe is cheap and tasty.&quot;
Ingredients

    1/4 cup butter
    1/4 cup all-purpose flour
    1/2 teaspoon salt

    ground black pepper to taste
    2 cups milk
    2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions

    Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.
    Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; stir in flour, salt, and pepper until smooth, about 5 minutes. Slowly pour milk into butter-flour mixture while continuously stirring until mixture is smooth and bubbling, about 5 minutes. Add Cheddar cheese to milk mixture and stir until cheese is melted, 2 to 4 minutes.
    Fold macaroni into cheese sauce until coated.

		<string>&quot;No canned soup mix in this recipe! Mushrooms, onions, celery, and peas all go into this comfort casserole.&quot;
Ingredients

    1/2 cup butter, divided
    1 (8 ounce) package uncooked medium egg noodles
    1/2 medium onion, finely chopped
    1 stalk celery, finely chopped
    1 clove garlic, minced
    8 ounces button mushrooms, sliced
    1/4 cup all-purpose flour

    2 cups milk
    salt and pepper to taste
    2 (5 ounce) cans tuna, drained and flaked
    1 cup frozen peas, thawed
    3 tablespoons bread crumbs
    2 tablespoons butter, melted
    1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese

Directions

    Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Butter a medium baking dish with 1 tablespoon butter.
    Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add egg noodles, cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente, and drain.
    Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium-low heat. Stir in the onion, celery, and garlic, and cook 5 minutes, until tender. Increase heat to medium-high, and mix in mushrooms. Continue to cook and stir 5 minutes, or until most of the liquid has evaporated.
    Melt 4 tablespoons butter in a medium saucepan, and whisk in flour until smooth. Gradually whisk in milk, and continue cooking 5 minutes, until sauce is smooth and slightly thickened. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in tuna, peas, mushroom mixture, and cooked noodles. Transfer to the baking dish. Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a small bowl, mix with bread crumbs, and sprinkle over the casserole. Top with cheese.
    Bake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until bubbly and lightly browned.

		<string>&quot;This is something I threw together one day when I was faced with an abundance of fresh cherry tomatoes and basil from my garden. Delish!&quot;
Ingredients

    1 (10 ounce) basket cherry tomatoes, halved
    1 tablespoon olive oil
    1 teaspoon minced garlic
    salt and ground black pepper to taste

    4 ounces angel hair pasta
    3 basil leaves, cut into thin strips, or more to taste

Directions

    Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
    Combine tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper in a bowl until well mixed; spread on a shallow-sided baking sheet.
    Bake in the preheated oven until tomatoes are soft and wrinkled, 25 to 30 minutes.
    Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain; reserving a small amount of cooking water.
    Spoon tomatoes with their juices into a small saucepan; add basil and red pepper flakes. Mix in reserved cooking water to thin tomato mixture to desired consistency. Cook and stir over low heat until warmed, about 5 minutes; stir in pasta. Top with Parmesan cheese before serving.

		<string>&quot;Chicken salad often finds its way to my summer menus, served on greens or a croissant. I think this one is just a little special. It&apos;s sweet and juicy from the apples and grapes, a little savory from the tarragon, crunchy from the pecans and celery, and lightened up a bit with some yogurt.&quot;
Ingredients

    1 1/2 cups grilled skinless, boneless chicken thighs, chopped
    1/2 red apple - peeled, cored, and diced
    1/2 cup halved green grapes
    1/3 cup toasted chopped pecans
    1/4 cup diced red onion
    1/4 cup diced celery

    1/4 cup mayonnaise
    1/4 cup low-fat plain Greek yogurt
    2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon
    1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
    1 lime, zested and juiced
    salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

Directions

    Combine chicken, apple, grapes, pecans, red onion, and celery in a medium bowl.
    Whisk mayonnaise, yogurt, tarragon, Dijon mustard, and lime zest and juice together in a small bowl. Stir dressing into the chicken mixture. Season with salt and pepper.
